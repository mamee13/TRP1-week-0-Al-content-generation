[Intro: Soft Lofi Beats]
In the digital quiet, where the shadows play,
We're building frontiers, in a silicon way.
[Verse 1]
Lines of code like stardust, falling from the sky,
Underneath the neon, where the dreams don't die.
[Chorus]
Oh, artificial heart, beating in the machine,
Mapping out the logic, in the world between.
[Outro: Fade out with vinyl crackle]
